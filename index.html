<h1 style="color:gray"> 3 Pitches for Data Journalism </h1>

<p> 1) Use cooking.nytimes.com to create a timeline of cultural trends. <br>

2) Use K-Visa data to reveal changes in the world (of love and marriage) since DOMA was struck down. <br>

3) Use US News & World Report college profiles to see how/if the price of tuition influences student behavior. <p>

<h1>1. We Are What We Have Eaten, a Timeline</h1>
<h2>For 'Recipe Redux' in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em></h2>
<p> An investigation into the most (and least) popular ingredients called for by recipes published in the<a href="nytimes.com" target="_blank"> New York Times</a> which <strong>reveals cultural truths, identifies lifestyle trends and sheds light on who we are by chronicling what we eat</strong> in a timeline format. Follow up questions might include: <br>
a) What impact does scientific understanding of nutrition have on our diets by decade? <br>
b) Can The Exotic survive globalization? <br>
c) Is locavorism a revolutionary movement or a rehash? </p> 

<p> <strong>Methodology:</strong><br> 
I hope to get more sophisticated than counting words with <a href="http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/" target="_blank">chronicle.nytlabs.com/" </a> (eventhough it's super-cool) and learn how to leverage the trove of structured data on which I assume the newly launched <a href="cooking.nytimes.com" target="_blank">cooking.nytimes.com</a> is based. Generating a word count by year (excluding stop words) limited exclusively to the 1600+ recipes dating back to 1981 would be the jumping off point. Then I'll sort, filter and aggregate the data in order to identify key moments (and movements) with which to populate an interactive timeline(s) (using <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com" target="_blank">http://timeline.knightlab.com</a> or similar).</p> 

<p> I hope to use the values (aka quantities) associated with the strings (aka ingredients). Extracting that information information would allow me to make calculations about portions historically as well mashup some interesting comparisons. Creating a GUI that explores the cumulative amount of a given ingredient in any given year might amount to something. Is more or less butter called for these days? Has olive oil ever come close to supplanting butter? Do butter usage trends relate to heart attack rates for the same period? </p>

<h1>2. A Kiss that Begins with K-Visa or <br>Immigration after DoMA</h1>
<h2>For <em>The New Republic</em></h2>
<p> When DoMA was stuck down by the US Supreme Court in June 2013, US embassies and consulates began to adjudicate nonimmigrant visas applications for same sex couples just as they do for opposite sex couples (K-1 Visas for spouses and K-3 Visas for fiancé/fiancées). <strong>The focus of my investigation will be to compare the rates of application and approvals of K-Visas submitted by same sex couples with opposite sex couples’</strong>. Follow up questions include:<br>

a) How many couples have been united that previously might have been kept apart? How far apart?<br>
b) Is there any predominance from where same sex partners emigrate? Are they fleeing homophobic regimes and persecution?<br>
Some of those answers might be served in a map and I'd like to polish my mapping skills. </p>


<strong>Research</strong>:<br>
<p> The US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs publishes some data tables on their website, but I haven’t been able to find a report with detailed demographics on K- Visas. I am in touch with someone trying to put me in touch with a Consular Officer who might be able to point me towards more specific data.</p> 

<p> In the meantime, I was able to find one <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2013AnnualReport/FY13AnnualReport-TableXVII.pdf" target="_blank">table</a> which lumps the entire K category as one and reports on the number issued by country. It's not exactly what I'm looking for but for fun, I converted the PDF to a spreadsheet and cleaned it. Then I used <a href="cartodb.com" target="_blank">cartodb.com</a> to merge a geocoded shapefile and created a choropleth map. For even more fun(?) I also cross referenced a UN table of divorce rates by country and included that statistic on my map.</p>

<h1>3. At the Nation's Most Expensive Schools, What are they Studying?</h1>
<h2>For the <a href="http://chronicle.com/">Chronicle of Higher Education
</a></h2>
<p> As the rise of tuition costs outpaces all other costs, the Obama administration has taken on the mantle of reforming the federal student loan program, MOOCS are disrupting the traditional university setting, and ridiculously successful startups are founded by men without degrees, is college even worth the price of admission? For those who pay to go, what are they doing there and does how much they pay influence the subject matter they study? Social and economic theorists like Richard Thaler and Ian Ayres might say that it does since they have proven that monetary investments and the psychology surrounding human tendency for hyperbolic discounting strongly influences behavior. </p>
<p>I'd like to create a tuition slider that displays the most popular majors at certain price points and other comparison sliders which could be deemed relevant.</p>

<strong>Methodology:</strong> <br>
<p> To get the data to build the slider I'll have to figure out how to scrape "US News &amp; World Report" profiles of 1800 colleges, complete with tuition costs and top 5 most popular majors. Then I'll have to learn javascript to build comparative sliders that will help readers (sliders?) acertain which factors affect the popularity of a major. Perhaps geography or the size of the school? Have certain areas of study fallen out of favor lately?<br>
