the pioneer of online polling and market research.</p>
<p>During the most recent US election cycle YouGov
successfully predicted the outcome of the Presidential
race as well as a number of Senatorial races, and
successfully predicts election results around Europe.
YouGov is not only extremely accurate with its predictive
forecasts, but is also the only top performing research
firm that utilizes online polling exclusively to predict
election results.</p>
<p>YouGov has offices in the US, UK, Europe and the Middle
East.</p>
<p>YouGov Results in 2010 US Elections</p></div><div data-pane="methodology" class="pane"><p>YouGov's general population samples are selected from
its panel to match the distribution of demographics and
other characteristics in the adult U.S. population: age,
race, gender, education, employment, income, marital
status, number of children (from the 2010 American
Community Survey), voter registration, time and location
of internet access (from the Current Population November
2010 and October 2009 supplements), interest in politics,
religion, and church attendance (from the Pew Religious
Landscape Survey of 2008).</p>
<p>Stratified subsamples (on four demographics) are
selected from YouGov's opt-in panel and invited to
participate in surveys. Samples are weighted by propensity
score deciles estimated from the remaining variables using
a case-control logistic regression.</p></div><div data-pane="privacy" class="pane"><p>The information our users provide is confidential. We
do not sell or disclose this personal information to
anyone at any time although we may report the
information in aggregate form (e.g., "65 percent of
those aged 65+ reported a high level of interest in the
presidential debate").</p>
